                <p>The double bass, also known as the contrabass, is the largest and lowest-pitched member of the string instrument family. It typically has four strings tuned in perfect fourths. Played with a bow or plucked, it provides the foundational bass line in classical, jazz, and various other music genres. With a deep, resonant sound, the double bass serves as both a melodic and rhythmic anchor in orchestras and ensembles. Its size and shape make it stand upright on the floor, requiring the musician to either sit or stand while playing.</p>
