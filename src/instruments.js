      description: "The double bass, also known as the contrabass, is the largest and lowest-pitched member of the string instrument family. It typically has four strings tuned in perfect fourths. Played with a bow or plucked, it provides the foundational bass line in classical, jazz, and various other music genres. With a deep, resonant sound, the double bass serves as both a melodic and rhythmic anchor in orchestras and ensembles. Its size and shape make it stand upright on the floor, requiring the musician to either sit or stand while playing.",

The viola serves a vital role in orchestras and chamber music, providing a middle voice that bridges the gap between the higher-pitched violins and the lower-pitched cellos and basses. Its expressive capabilities contribute to a wide range of musical genres, showcasing its versatility in both classical and contemporary settings.",
